Building 5 to 10 small projects covering core React concepts should be enough to understand any React-based code. Focus on projects that involve:

Component-based architecture – Build a simple counter or to-do app.

State management (useState, useReducer) – Create a quiz or calculator.

Props & Context API – Build a theme switcher.

Event handling & forms – Develop a login or feedback form.

React Router – Make a multi-page blog or portfolio site.

API integration (fetch, Axios) – Develop a weather or GitHub profile viewer.

Custom hooks – Implement a custom dark mode or local storage hook.

Performance optimization (useMemo, useCallback) – Optimize an e-commerce cart.

State management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Recoil) – Build a task manager.

Real-time features (WebSockets, Firebase, Socket.IO) – Create a chat app.

After these, you should be comfortable reading and working with most React-based projects.
